Full Guide on how the program is built.

The text editor application built with Python and Tkinter is structured using a class called SimpleTextEditor. The first part of the code sets up the imports, bringing in tkinter for GUI, scrolledtext for a text box with a built-in scrollbar, filedialog and messagebox for file and dialog operations, and os for file path handling. The shebang and module docstring are informative and help define the context of the script.

The class SimpleTextEditor initializes the editor by taking a root window and configuring the application window. It sets a title, defines a default size of 800x600 pixels, and ensures the window cannot be resized smaller than 400x300. It then creates a main_frame which serves as a container for widgets using the pack geometry manager with both fill and expand enabled to make the UI responsive. The initialization then delegates creation of the menu bar and text area to two separate methods, following clean object-oriented design.

The create_menu_bar method sets up the top-level menu. It creates a Menu object attached to the root, then constructs a File menu as a cascade. This menu has commands for Open, Save, Save As, and Exit, each mapped to the corresponding methods. Visual keyboard shortcuts are shown using the accelerator argument. However, to make them functional, real bindings are applied using root.bind with the appropriate Control key combinations, including a lambda to call the correct function when the key is pressed. The Open command is linked to self.open_file, Save to self.save_file, and Save As to self.save_as_file. Exit is tied to self.exit_app.

The create_text_area method constructs the ScrolledText widget. This widget, placed inside main_frame, provides a text box with automatic vertical scrolling. It wraps text at word boundaries and enables undo functionality. The default font is set to TkDefaultFont at size 12. The widget is packed to fill all available space with padding on all sides and is given focus as soon as the app opens so the user can type immediately.

The open_file method checks if the user has unsaved changes using edit_modified. If changes exist, it prompts with a yes/no/cancel dialog using messagebox. If the user cancels or saving fails, the method returns early. Otherwise, it shows an open file dialog using filedialog.askopenfilename, with filters for .txt and all files. If a file is selected, it opens the file in read mode, reads the content, and inserts it into the text area after clearing any previous content. The current_file attribute is updated, the window title is changed accordingly, and the modified flag is reset to reflect the new, saved state.

The save_file method checks whether current_file is set. If it is, the content from the text area is retrieved and written to that file using open in write mode. The modified flag is reset. If any error occurs during saving, a messagebox displays the error and False is returned. If current_file is None, meaning the file hasn't been saved before, it delegates the action to save_as_file, ensuring that the user is prompted to choose a save location first.

The save_as_file method displays a save file dialog using asksaveasfilename. If the user selects a file path, it sets current_file to that path, updates the title, and then calls save_file to handle the actual writing. If the user cancels, it simply returns False. This separation of concerns allows the app to treat save and save as differently based on user context, improving usability and preventing data loss.

The update_title method modifies the root window’s title. If a file is currently open, it uses os.path.basename to extract just the filename (not the full path) and sets the title accordingly. If no file is open, it resets the title to "Simple Text Editor". This visual feedback helps the user know what they’re working on at all times.

The exit_app method checks for unsaved changes before closing the app. If there are changes, it prompts the user with the same yes/no/cancel dialog. If the user cancels or saving fails, it aborts the exit. Otherwise, it calls root.destroy to close the window and end the app. This method is tied to the window close button via root.protocol("WM_DELETE_WINDOW", app.exit_app) in the main function.

The main function is the entry point. It creates the main Tk window, passes it to the SimpleTextEditor class, connects the window close button to the exit handler, and then starts the mainloop which keeps the GUI running. The use of if name == "main": main() ensures that this code only runs when executed directly, not when imported as a module, which is a best practice in Python.

The entire structure is modular, readable, and user-focused. It protects the user from accidental data loss, shows visual cues like file names and unsaved changes, and separates UI construction from functionality. The use of class-based design keeps state and behavior tightly coupled. The logic handles edge cases, such as cancelled dialogs or errors during file operations, gracefully.

This text editor is a great foundation. It is basic but complete, and it includes thoughtful UX decisions like setting focus to the text area, enabling undo, showing keyboard shortcuts, and warning about unsaved changes. Its architecture is extensible—features like undo/redo, themes, syntax highlighting, or plugins could be layered on top. As a beginner-friendly project, it’s excellent for learning Tkinter, GUI design, file I/O, and event-driven programming in Python. As a base for further development, it’s already built with the future in mind.
