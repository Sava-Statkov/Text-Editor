# Text Editor (Python + Tkinter)

This project is a desktop-based text editor built using the Tkinter library in Python. It provides essential file-handling capabilities such as open, save, and save as, along with undo/redo functionality, zoom controls, and a read-only mode. The application includes both light and dark themes, with customizable interface elements to enhance user experience.

## Features

- Scrollable text area with word wrapping
- Dynamic font resizing with zoom in/out/reset options
- Undo and redo functionality
- Keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Ctrl+S, Ctrl+O, Ctrl+Z)
- Light mode and dark mode switching
- Read-only mode toggle
- Desktop shortcut support for launching the application
- Dialog prompts for handling unsaved changes
- Organized theme and font management

## Purpose

The goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience in GUI application development with Python. It demonstrates practical implementation of file I/O operations, interactive widget design, and basic UI state handling. The structure follows a modular approach with attention to user usability, error handling, and code maintainability.

## Future Improvements

- Syntax highlighting for specific file types
- Find and replace functionality
- File history or autosave options
- Plugin support or theming via config

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (included with most Python installations)

## Running the Application

To run the application:

```bash
python text_editor.py
